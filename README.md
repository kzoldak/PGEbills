## Goal of Project
From November 9, 2018 to January 9, 2019 my main electric heater was broken and I was forced to use the very old window unit. This window unit did not have a thermostat and was extremely energy inefficient.
My goal is to prove to my property manager just how inefficient this old unit is and to recoup the costs to run it compared to my main heater. 

I am examining the costs over those two months and comparing them to the month before the heater broke and the month after. Unfortunately, since I moved into the apartment in early October and it is currently mid-February, I have no additional data. 
1. I will examine the energy usage per day and compare this to temperatures in Lafayette, CA. 
2. I will examine my monthly energy usage and compare to the monthly average temperatures. 

In this process, I need to take into account the cost, as the rate per kWh changes. The data provides energy usage and cost/kWh for every hour of every day from 2018-10-04,00:00,00:59 to 2019-02-11,23:00,23:59. More information is provided under the data section. 

## Data
All data can be found within the `/data/` directory.
### PGE bill
- pge_electric_interval_data__2018-10-04_to_2019-02-11.csv


### Weather data
- weatherdata.csv
The weather data was downloaded from [NOAA's Climate Website](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov). Daily average temperatures matching the dates of my energy bills were downloaded to overlay the temperatures on the energy usage.
